There are 4 access modifiers in C++ : 
- public
- private 
- protected 
- friend 
- protected friend

## Member functions

- Inside Class Function --> inline keyword
- Outside Class Function --> scope resolution operator (::)

## Polymorphism is categorised into 2 types : 
- Function / Operator Overloading
- Function Overriding

## 5 Types of Inheritance 

- Single
- Mutliple
- Hierarchical
- Multilevel

`Encapsulation is the combination of Data hiding and Abstraction`

```
Data abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users.

How to achieve : 
  1) C++  --> Access specifiers and header files
  2) JAVA --> Interfaces and Abstract classes
```
